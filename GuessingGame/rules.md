#### Rules of the game

A random number is chosen by the game in a specific range (0-10) and the user has to guess which number it is. 

After each guess the program tells you if the guessed number equals to the random number chosen by the game or if it is higher or lower.

As soon as the user selects the chosen number, user wins and game is over.
